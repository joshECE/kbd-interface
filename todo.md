## To do:

- make a good c++ model that passes a realistic clk/data waveform to top.v
- Test the current version of kbd_infc.v
- Fully complete kbd_infc.v so that it can read a full 32-bit keyboard scan code
- improve the c++ model so that it can take an input clk/data waveform, determine the correct output and then pass the waveforms into kbd_infc.v and compare the verilog output to its own output.
