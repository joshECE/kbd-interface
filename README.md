The point of this project is to implement a PS/2 protocol betweena keyboard and a Nexys4DDR FPGA development board. This will be demonstrated using the boards built-in 7 segment display, where all of the keys being pressed by the user will be simultaneously printed on the display.


The initial stage will be to write a design file that allows the board to read the data from the keyboard, byte by byte.
