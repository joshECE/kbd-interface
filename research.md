### This is just notes

What scan code is sent if a key is held down? 
The make scan code will be transmitted repeatedly at a fast rate.

What if multiple are held down at the same time? 
The scan code will only be repeated for the most recently pressed key.

^^ Might still be able to tell if two keys are being held down if a the make codes for multiple keys are recieved but no break codes.
